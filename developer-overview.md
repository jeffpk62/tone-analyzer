# Overview for developers
{: #overviewDevelopers}

You can access the capabilities of the {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service via an HTTP Representational State Transfer (REST) API. Several Software Development Kits (SDKs) are also available to simplify application development in various languages and environments. The following sections provide an overview of application development with the service.

## Programming with the service
{: #programming}

To analyze the tone of an individual's text, you pass the input text to the service via the `GET` or `POST /v3/tone` method. To analyze the exchanges in a conversation, you pass input to the service via the `POST /v3/tone_chat` method. In both cases, the service returns its analysis in JSON format.

For more information, see [Using the general purpose endpoint](/docs/services/tone-analyzer/using-tone.html) and [Using the customer engagement endpoint](/docs/services/tone-analyzer/using-tone-chat.html).

## Using Software Development Kits
{: #sdks}

The {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service supports a number of SDKs for simplified application development. The SDKs are available for many popular programming languages and platforms, including Node.js, Java, Python, and Apple&reg; iOS. For a complete list of SDKs and information about using them, see [{{site.data.keyword.watson}} SDKs](/docs/services/watson/getting-started-sdks.html). All SDKs are available from the [watson-developer-cloud namespace ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud){: new_window} on GitHub.

For mobile development, see the [{{site.data.keyword.watson}} Developer Cloud Swift SDK ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/swift-sdk){: new_window}. All SDKs support authenticating by using either your service credentials or an authentication token.

## Learning more about application development
{: #learn}

The {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service supports two typical programming models: *Direct interaction*, in which the client communicates with the service directly; and *relaying via a proxy*, in which the client and service exchange all data (requests and results) through a proxy application that resides in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}}.

For more information about working with {{site.data.keyword.watson}} Developer Cloud services and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, see the following:

-   For an introduction to working with {{site.data.keyword.watson}} services and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.watson}} and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}](/docs/services/watson/index.html).
-   For a language-independent introduction to developing {{site.data.keyword.watson}} services applications in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, see [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} development approaches](/docs/services/watson/getting-started-bluemix.html).
-   For information about the two programming models available for developing {{site.data.keyword.watson}} applications, see [Programming models for {{site.data.keyword.watson}} services](/docs/services/watson/getting-started-develop.html):
    -   With relaying via a proxy, the client relies on a proxy server that resides in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} to communicate with the service; it passes all requests through the proxy application. Relaying requests via a proxy relies only on service credentials to authenticate with the service; see [Service credentials for {{site.data.keyword.watson}} services](/docs/services/watson/getting-started-credentials.html).
    -   With direct interaction, the client uses the proxy application in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} only to obtain an authentication token for the service, after which it communicates directly with the service. Direct interaction uses service credentials only to obtain a token; see [Tokens for authentication](/docs/services/watson/getting-started-tokens.html).
-   For information about controlling the default request logging that is performed for all {{site.data.keyword.watson}} services, see [Controlling request logging for {{site.data.keyword.watson}} services](/docs/services/watson/getting-started-logging.html).
